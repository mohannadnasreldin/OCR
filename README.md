## Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Handwritten English Letters using Decision Tree and Random Forest in Python



### Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Python-based solution for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of handwritten English letters. The project utilizes the power of decision tree and random forest algorithms to accurately classify and recognize handwritten characters.

### Key Features
- **OCR Algorithms:** The repository implements decision tree and random forest algorithms, which are powerful machine learning techniques, to recognize handwritten English letters. These algorithms are trained on a labeled dataset of handwritten letters to learn the patterns and characteristics of different letters.

- **Handwritten Letter Recognition:** The OCR system is capable of accurately identifying and recognizing handwritten English letters. By inputting an image or scanned document containing handwritten letters, the system applies the trained models to classify each letter and provide the corresponding recognized text.

- **Python Implementation:** The project is implemented using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language. Python's rich ecosystem of libraries and tools enables efficient data manipulation, machine learning model training, and image processing.

### Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mohannadnasreldin/OCR.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd OCR
   ```


### Dataset and Model Customization
The repository comes with a sample dataset and pre-trained models for convenience. However, you can customize the dataset by collecting your own handwritten letter samples and updating the training dataset accordingly. Additionally, you can experiment with different hyperparameters and configurations of decision tree and random forest models to achieve better OCR performance.
